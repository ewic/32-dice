      <strong>Object of the Game</strong>
      <p>
        To move one of your dice onto your opponent’s back line without that die being immediately taken by your opponent on their very next turn.
      </p>

      <strong>Set Up</strong>
      <p>
        Each player takes either the red or black set of sixteen dice and prepares to set up at opposite ends of the board. Players then simultaneously roll each of their sixteen dice, one at a time. Once rolled, each die is placed immediately on the board. This commences of the left square on a player’s back row and continues across to the right. On completion of the back row, the dice are placed from the left again on the next row up. After each roll, each die must be placed onto the next available square. Players cannot select on which square they would like to place each die. Once both players have completed the set up, play commences.
      </p>
      <strong>Rules</strong>
      <p>
        The player with the most sixes starts (if the players have the same amount, then the player with the most fives starts and so on). Players take one turn each alternately. A player can move any one die the number of squares that corresponds to the number showing on that die. For example, if that number is a 3, the player can move that die forwards, backwards, sideways or diagonally up or down in a straight line over three squares. Within the movement the die cannot pass over any other die (either an opponent’s die or their own). If any move results in a die landing on a square occupied by an opponent’s die then the opponent’s die is ‘taken’ and removed from the board. Instead of moving a die on any turn a player can opt to rotate one of their dice 90 degrees. For example a die with a 3 showing can be turned over to a 1,2,5 or 6 whilst remaining on its current square. This movement constitutes a player’s turn.
      </p>
      <strong>Winning the Game</strong>
      <p>
      The first player to get one of their dice onto any square along their opponent’s back row, which their opponent cannot then take on their very next turn, wins the game.
